Essential Programming concept: 
1.you should be able to install python. 

--> Download Python Installer
    Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
    Locate the downloaded installer file (.exe) and open it.
    Important: On the installation screen, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" at the
    bottom. This ensures you can run Python from the command prompt.
    "Customize Installation" if you want to specify a different installation path.
    Verify Installation:
    Open Command Prompt (type cmd in the search bar).
    Type python --version or python to check if Python is installed and to confirm the version.

2.you should be able to install Django framework 

--> Install Django:
    pip install django
    
    Verify Installation:
    python -m django --version

3.you should be able to create basic python Django application 

--> 1. Create a New Django Project:
    	django-admin startproject myproject
			OR
   	 python-m django startproject myproject
   
    	Navigate to Your Project Directory:
    	cd myproject

   	 Run the Development Server:
   	 python manage.py runserver

    2. Create a Django App:
    	Create a New App:
	python manage.py startapp myapp

        Register the App:
        Go to myproject/settings.py and add the new app to the INSTALLED_APPS list:
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
			   'myapp',
			]
    3. Define a Simple View:
        Create a View in myapp:
        Open myapp/views.py and define simple view.
        from django.http import HttpResponse

	def home(request):
    	    return HttpResponse("Hello, welcome to my basic Django app!")
        
        Set Up the URL for the View:
        In myapp, create a file named urls.py (if it doesn’t already exist) and add the
        following:

        from django.urls import path
        from . import views

	urlpatterns = [
    			path('', views.home, name='home'),  
			# This connects the home view to the root URL
		      ]
        Go to myproject/urls.py and include myapp’s URLs by adding the following line:

        from django.contrib import admin
        from django.urls import path, include

        urlpatterns = [
    			path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
   			path('', include('myapp.urls')),  # Include myapp’s URLs
		      ]

        Add a Template:
        Inside myapp/templates/myapp/, create a file called home.html

        Modify the home view in myapp/views.py:
        from django.shortcuts import render

        def home(request):
            return render(request, 'myapp/home.html')
 
    Run the Server and View the App:
    python manage.py runserver
 
    Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in a browser, and you should see the content from home.html.
      

    Installing Specific Django Versions:
    pip install django==3.2  # Replace 3.2 with the version you want

4.you should be able to host and run web application Django.

--> 

5.you should be comfortable with files and folder created by Django. 
6.you should be comfortable with request response life cycle of Django. 
7.you should be knowing MVT framework 
8.you should create and maintain proper folders for model, forms, templates.
9.you should be comfortable in understanding static and dynamic pages using DTL 
10.Object oriented Programming concepts using python   
	a. create class, define members, add member functions, defining main function   
	b. create constructor, destructor, to string ,getter, setter self keyword   
	c. encapsulation   
	c. create array, collections   
	d. understand basic syntax for looping, conditions, switch   
	e. input and output on console   
	f. inheritance   
	g. abstract class, abstract method   
	h. interface, multiple interface inheritance 	
11. File IO 
12. Serialization 
13. Reflection 
14. Creating package in python

Folder Structure:
Django project with multiple apps (blog and shop) might organize its template files:

myproject/
├── blog/
│   ├── templates/
│   │   └── blog/
│   │       ├── index.html
│   │       └── post_detail.html
│   └── views.py
├── shop/
│   ├── templates/
│   │   └── shop/
│   │       ├── index.html
│   │       └── product_detail.html
│   └── views.py
└── myproject/
    └── settings.py
